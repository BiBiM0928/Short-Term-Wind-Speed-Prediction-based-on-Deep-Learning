# Short-Term-Wind-Speed-Prediction-based-on-Deep-Learning
LSTM neural network realizes the prediction of wind speed through the learning of various parameters. It can provide important support for the smooth operation of power system and the optimization of control strategy. The fuzzy rough set theory is used to reduce many factors that affect wind speed. It simplifies the input of the neural network prediction model and improves the accuracy and speed. Compared with the traditional neural network prediction method, MAE and MAPE in FRS-LSTM wind speed forecasting model have decreased and the accuracy has been improved greatly.
